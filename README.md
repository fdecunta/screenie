## LLM-Assisted Systematic Review Screening Tool

**Work in progress, very early stage!**

A lightweight desktop app to assist researchers in the **title/abstract screening phase** of systematic reviews.  
It uses user-provided LLM APIs to classify papers against natural language inclusion criteria.

## Features
- Bring your own LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)  
- Import papers via CSV, RIS, or BibTeX  
- Define inclusion/exclusion criteria in plain English  
- LLM suggests **Include / Exclude** with short explanations  
- Human-in-the-loop to validate the process.
- Save and resume projects locally
