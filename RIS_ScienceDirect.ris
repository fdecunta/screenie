AB  - This study describes the feeding ecology of an orbiniid polychaete, Leitoscoloplos fragilis Verrill, that is patchily distributed in the lower intertidal sands of Cape Henlopen, Delaware. The abundances of worms and potential food items (organic POC/PON, diatoms, bacteria) and several sedimentological and geochemical measurements were followed for 1 yr at two stations (designated HI and LO). Population densities of L. fragilis were significantly higher at Station HI throughout the year. The abundance of fine particles (< 125 μm) was always higher at Station LO. Activity-depth profiles of the particle radiotracer Be-7 suggested that L. fragilis did not significantly affect sediment turnover. Subsurface peaks in Be-7 activity-depth profiles were deeper in November than in August because of more intense physical disturbance. A greater abundance of fine particles are buried more rapidly at depth in August because the overall sediment transport and removal of fine particles are lower at this time of year. Standing stocks of bacteria and diatoms at each station were not significantly different. Microbenthic metabolic activity and ammonia production (from worm excretion and remineralization) were significantly higher at Station HI. In these coarse-grained sediments benthic diatoms are the major food resource for L. fragilis. A greater abundance of fines in this environment may impede the upward flux of the primary inorganic nitrogen source (ammonia) to surface diatoms. Benthic diatom production may be the major factor that controls population density of L. fragilis in sediment at Cape Henlopen.

AB  - As society grapples with the emerging significance and implications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or Google’s Gemini, as well as other advancements in modern generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is crucial to recognize the existing role that data, algorithms, and online social networks have already played in shaping our contemporary society. This review article provides the first comprehensive examination of the current state of knowledge, across disciplinary divides, on how online influences impact offline behaviors, laying the necessary groundwork for investigating and researching the potential impact that these new technologies will have on our “offline” lives. Through a deep-dive collection of articles (n=149), we review and analyze research with measurable Online-to-Offline impacts (n=88). Within this Online-to-Offline criteria, we identify five emergent cross-cutting themes, namely: Social Diffusion, Social Reinforcement, Social Boundary & Identity Maintenance, Cognitive and Attitudinal Research, and Research on Vulnerable & Marginalized Impacts. Through a second wave snowball collection process, we construct a citation network from the broader Online and Offline research literature, allowing us to locate the Online-to-Offline subset as part of a larger intellectual discussion. Finally, we conduct a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis of terms used in the titles of these online/offline research papers, from 1990 to 2023, to identify the evolution of researchers’ conceptualization and framing of Online and Offline research across the past 30 years. The meta-review, presentation of high-level cross-cutting interdisciplinary themes, co-citation network analysis, and TF-IDF analysis collectively provide a cohesive and deeper understanding of the research space of online/offline influences. By taking stock of the ways in which online factors have already shaped individual, group, or organizational behaviors and social dynamics broadly in “offline” contexts, this work aims to provide a cohesive theoretical and empirical foundation for future researchers to better anticipate, address, and frame the future consequences of the rapidly evolving digitally influenced landscape we find ourselves in today.

AB  - Incorporating cyber artifacts into Cyber-Socio-Technical Systems (CSTSs) poses new challenges to human safety due to their increasingly unpredictable behavior. Resilience is the ability to adapt, recover, and bounce back from challenges, setbacks, or adversity. Quantifying the resilience of CSTSs requires the identification of leading or lagging indicators. Among the leading indicators, allostatic load measures the level of systemic tension accumulated from misalignments in the perspectives of system actors regarding how work should be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to measure allostatic load. This approach involves lightweight modelling of process perspectives, extraction of token vectors from process function descriptions, and computing vector similarity by using the Dice similarity algorithm. Then, allostatic load is defined as the complement to one of the similarity value. An example application concerning a chemical spill in a hospital laboratory demonstrates the method’s practical use.

AB  - Effective evidence synthesis is important for the integration of scientific research into decision-making. However, fully depicting the vast mosaic of concepts and applications in environmental sciences and ecology often entails a substantial workload. New Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools present an attractive option for addressing this challenge but require sufficient validation to match the vigorous standards of a systematic review. This article demonstrates the use of generative AI in the selection of relevant literature as part of a systematic review on indicators of ecosystem condition. We highlight, through the development of an optimal prompt to communicate inclusion and exclusion criteria, the need to describe ecosystem condition as a multidimensional concept whilst also maintaining clarity on what does not meet the criteria of comprehensiveness. We show that, although not completely infallible, the GPT-3.5 model significantly outperforms traditional literature screening processes in terms of speed and efficiency whilst correctly selecting 83 % of relevant literature for review. Our study highlights the importance of precision in prompt design and the setting of query parameters for the AI model and opens the perspective for future work using language models to contextualize complex concepts in the environmental sciences. Future development of this methodology in tandem with the continued evolution of the accessibility and capacity of AI tools presents a great potential to improve evidence synthesis through gains in efficiency and possible scope.

AB  - We introduce a novel text-analytic methodology for conducting systematic literature reviews in management research. By examining abstracts of articles published in leading management journals between 2000 and 2023, we assess the influence and interplay of four major theories: transaction cost economics (TCE) and agency theory (AT) from the economics domain and population ecology theory (PET) and institutional theory (IT) from the sociology domain. Our approach includes custom dictionary creation and probability scoring, allowing the quantification of theoretical inclinations in academic literature. Results indicate that IT, from the sociology field, was most influential from 2000 to 2018, whereas AT, from the economics field, gained prominence from 2018 onward. This dynamic interplay illustrates a competitive complementarity between economics and sociology, highlighting a shift in theoretical focus over time. Our study contributes to existing literature at two levels – conceptual and methodological. Conceptually, it provides insights into how economic and sociological paradigms have shaped management and strategy scholarship. Methodologically, it offers a custom-built quantitative method that facilitates the analysis of qualitative content across extensive literature bodies, validated through comparisons with established tools such as LIWC, VOSViewer, and BERT. While this study serves as a proof of concept with a focus on four theories, the methodology can be expanded to explore broader theoretical landscapes in management and related fields. Future research can build upon this framework by integrating additional theories and applying advanced machine learning tools to further advance the field of organizational studies.

AB  - This article explores artificial intelligence (AI) effects on data center electricity consumption by answering the question if and when AI growth may cause an electricity crisis. We study this through combining 3 AI demand electricity and 3 electricity supply scenarios to 9 scenarios and simulating these for estimating their longer-term outcomes on anticipated reserve margins (ARM). These scenarios contain multiple theoretical constructs for explaining AI impact on data centers via a system dynamics narrative, i.e. non-linear predictions with feedback mechanisms through time. We apply our system dynamics simulation model to a specific region because possible conflicts between data center electricity demand and electricity supply capacity manifest themselves only at a regional level. As a case for our simulations, we selected Texas-Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT): an electricity region covering most of the state of Texas. Being a very energy rich area, we see only a few conditions in which an AI electricity crisis, i.e., an ARM below the reference margin level (RML), may happen in Texas-ERCOT, but a decline of the ARM from 31.2% in 2025 to between 7 (which is below the needed 13.75% RML) and 25% in 2030 with data centers taking about 21–26% of all electricity available may likely happen around 2030. The application of our method in other regions may give very different outcomes, but also the Texas-ERCOT region is not free of risks. While this paper focuses on direct AI impacts, it also suggests the need for future studies exploring the indirect effects of increased data center usage on the economy, society, and ecology.

AB  - Observations were made of social and territorial behaviour in a wild high-density population of Mongolian gerbils. The social units were multi-male, multi-female age-structured groups, judged to be families. The operational sex ratio was male biased. Group size varied from two to about 17 animals. Non-overlapping territories were defined by a clustered distribution of burrows, by common areas of activity of group members, and by chases across border zones between the areas used by each group. Territory size was correlated with group size, and ranged from 325 to 1550 m2. Within groups, differential social status was indicated by behaviour patterns of dominant as well as subordinate character. Larger individuals dominated smaller ones, and males usually dominated females. Males ranged more widely and they were generally more active than females. The rate of sexual maturation in subadults varied according to group composition. Mainly the largest reproductively active males defended the territories by chasing, and also by marking along borders. An increased marking rate was observed in reproductively active males and females during oestrus. Three females were observed to copulate, two with more than one male. One female preferentially copulated with a neighbouring male. The functions of territorial defence, marking behaviour and promiscuous mating are discussed, and some cross-species comparisons are made. The present observations are to a large extent compatible with the results of relevant laboratory and seminatural studies.

Urban morphology study is first presented, and regression models are estimated for each landscape index as a function of distances to the major metropolitan area central business districts (CBDs). Multiple functional forms have been tested for the models. Overall, the results provide evidence of the importance of role of CBDs on the landscape structure.

AB  - The fields of taxonomy and biodiversity research have witnessed an exponential growth in published literature. This vast corpus of articles holds information on the diverse biological traits of organisms and their ecologies. However, access to and extraction of relevant data from this extensive resource remain challenging. Advances in text and data mining (TDM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques offer new opportunities for liberating such information from literature. Testing and using such approaches to annotate articles in machine-actionable formats is, therefore, necessary to enable the exploitation of existing knowledge in new biology, ecology and evolution research. Here, we explore the potential of these methods to annotate and extract organismal trait data for the most diverse animal group on Earth, the arthropods. The article processing workflow uses manually curated trait dictionaries with trained NLP models to perform labelling of entities and relationships of thousands of articles. A subset of manually annotated documents facilitated the formal evaluation of the performance of the workflow in terms of entity recognition and normalisation and relationship extraction, highlighting several important technical challenges. The results are made available to the scientific community through an interactive web tool and queryable resource, the ArTraDB Arthropod Trait Database. These methodological explorations provide a framework that could be extended beyond the arthropods, where TDM and NLP approaches applied to the taxonomy and biodiversity literature will greatly facilitate data synthesis studies and literature reviews, the identification of knowledge gaps and biases, as well as the data-informed investigation of ecological and evolutionary trends and patterns.

Recently, we are witnessing a rising trend that utilizes various deep-learning methods to facilitate cross-domain data fusion in smart cities. To this end, we propose the first survey that systematically reviews the latest advancements in deep learning-based data fusion methods tailored for urban computing. Specifically, we first delve into data perspective to comprehend the role of each modality and data source. Secondly, we classify the methodology into four primary categories: feature-based, alignment-based, contrast-based, and generation-based fusion methods. Thirdly, we further categorize multi-modal urban applications into seven types: urban planning, transportation, economy, public safety, society, environment, and energy. Compared with previous surveys, we focus more on the synergy of deep learning methods with urban computing applications. Furthermore, we shed light on the interplay between Large Language Models (LLMs) and urban computing, postulating future research directions that could revolutionize the field. We firmly believe that the taxonomy, progress, and prospects delineated in our survey stand poised to significantly enrich the research community.

AB  - Understanding the role of baseflow is important for efficient river management. Hydrograph analysis separates baseflow from varying streamflow hydrographs. Separation of baseflow from streamflow and its analysis are crucial to flow regulations, water quantity, quality, and supply, and habitat. This study attempted to identify the annual and monthly contributions of baseflow on streamflow in Nepal. For this, the three techniques of WHAT, BFLOW, and HYSEP were implemented to separate baseflow from streamflow in two watersheds (the two basins). As a result, baseflow’s contribution is high in the post-monsoon (October and November) and winter seasons (December-February). The Baseflow Index (BFI) slightly decreases in value in the pre-monsoon (March-May) season; in the monsoon season (June-sept), the range of the BFI is at its lowest. As baseflow’s contribution exceeds 45 percent in all seasons, proper assessment of baseflow is crucial to efficient management of river ecology.

The digitisation of natural history collections represents a critical step towards preserving and increasing accessibility to valuable scientific data. Despite their fundamental importance to taxonomy, ecology and conservation, the world’s natural history collections remain underutilised due to the labour-intensive process of extracting metadata from specimen labels.
New information
This paper describes SpeciMate, a software application that uses a human-AI collaborative approach to accelerate the extraction of metadata from digitised specimen images. The system leverages artificial intelligence web services including optical character recognition (OCR), automated translation and large language and multimodal models (LLMs) to extract structured metadata, while requiring human expertise for prompt engineering and data curation. We describe the application's architecture, functionality and workflows, which enable effective processing of various specimen types including herbarium sheets and insect slides. Our trials indicate that this tool significantly improves the efficiency of metadata extraction while maintaining high data quality. The combination of automated AI processing with human supervision and refinement represents a promising approach to accelerating the digitisation and databasing of natural history collections, thereby enabling broader access to these invaluable resources for research, education and conservation efforts.

AB  - Accurate crop monitoring is crucial for global food security and sustainable agricultural management. Previously published studies are almost all trained in closed environments, limiting their capability to generalize beyond the training areas or to unseen crop categories, thus severely constraining the scalability and adaptability of crop monitoring. Zero-shot learning (ZSL)-based classification methods have made significant progress recently and provide an effective solution to the above challenges, which establishes the connection between seen and unseen categories through semantic knowledge. However, the semantic knowledge extracted by these methods often lacks the domain-specific details to distinguish different crop types. To this end, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework to explore the application of zero-shot learning in crop classification for the first time. Specifically, our method extracts visual features from time-series patches and the corresponding curves, then utilizes a large language model (LLM) to automatically generate high-quality time-series text descriptions. These descriptions provide unique phenological information and growth patterns for each crop type. Additionally, we further process keywords related to phenological information and growth patterns through a graph convolutional network (GCN) to effectively capture the interrelated phenological stages and spatial dependencies. Experimental results on three different study areas demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional supervised learning methods for crop classification as well as ZSL baseline methods. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and interpretability of leveraging time series data to explore visual information and semantic knowledge of crops for zero-shot crop classification across diverse regions and crop types.

AB  - ABSTRACT
A silent ansamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (ovm) was activated in Streptomyces olivaceus SCSIO T05 following mutagenesis and media optimization. A new shunt product, olimycin C (1a) was produced by the ovmO-inactivated mutant strain, along with a minor product, olimycin D (1b). The production of these linear olimycin counterparts suggest that luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM) OvmO catalyzes an on-PKS Baeyer–Villiger-type oxidation during assembly of the olimycin A (2) linear polyketide backbone.

AB  - Soil virus ecology is an exciting but still nascent field of research in soil microbiology. While there has been a recent surge in soil virus research studies, many fundamental questions remain unanswered, and a range of technical and bioinformatic challenges need to be overcome. In this perspective article, we present a series of key questions that highlight fruitful research areas for ongoing and future efforts. These include describing the challenges involved in understanding soil viral abundance and activity, spatiotemporal dynamics, life strategy prevalence, virus-mediated biogeochemical impacts, viral protein function, host prediction, and soil RNA virus discovery. In the near term, combining approaches (e.g., cultivation-based, meta-omics, biogeochemical, experimental, and bioinformatic) will be key to assessing the ecological and biogeochemical impacts of soil viruses from the microscopic to the field and global scales. Still, we stress that results must be tempered by current methodological limitations and highlight knowledge gaps that are most pressing to fill via new methods or measurements, such as the prevalence of different viral replication strategies across soils, the fate of microbial necromass carbon after viral lysis, the frequency of virus-host encounters that do not lead to successful infections yet could be bioinformatically mistaken as infections, and the diversity and ecological impacts of RNA viruses in soil.

AB  - The TEX86 (TetraEther indeX of tetraethers consisting of 86 carbon atoms) sea-surface temperature (SST) proxy is based on the distribution of isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) membrane lipids of pelagic Thaumarchaeota that are preserved in marine sediments. It is a valuable tool for reconstructing past SSTs from sedimentary archives; however there are still major uncertainties as to the effects of variables other than temperature on the proxy. Here we present the first study of GDGT variability across early Cretaceous interbedded pelagic and shelf-sourced turbiditic sediments from two Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) sites in the western North Atlantic. The results indicate that a small, but consistent, offset in TEX86 ratios, equivalent to ~1–2°C of temperature difference, occurs between interbedded lithologies of a similar age. The offset can be attributed to spatial differences in sea-surface temperatures or thaumarchaeotal populations between the shelf and the open ocean, or to secondary diagenetic effects related to oxic degradation of the GDGTs. Of these, a difference in either thaumarchaeotal taxa or ecology between those living in the shelf and ocean areas seems most plausible. Regardless of the root cause of the offset, these findings highlight the necessity of careful sample selection prior to TEX86 analysis, to ensure robust interpretation of palaeotemperature trends.

AB  - Hydrology investigates the water cycle and its relationship with the environment and societal activities, and forms the foundation for sustainable water resource management and ecological conservation. A quantitative review of hydrology aids in the scientific prediction of water resource trends, optimizing their allocation, and addressing challenges posed by climate change. However, traditional studies have lacked a systematic quantitative review of Chinese hydrology, particularly at the basin scale and across diverse research topics. Therefore, we employed advanced technologies, including large language models, regular expression techniques, and dynamic topic modeling, to conduct a quantitative analysis of hydrological research in China from 2000 to 2023 based on 289,513 hydrology-related publications. We examined the characteristics, research topics, and spatiotemporal evolution patterns of publications from China’s major basins. The results reveal a significant increase in Chinese hydrology publications (about 19 papers/year) and research collaboration (0.9 authors/decade). The soil and water assessment tool (46.7% usage), variable infiltration capacity model (15.7%), and Xinanjiang model (11.9%) were the most widely used hydrological models in Chinese research. The Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Haihe River basins received the most attention, with key research topics spanning water resources (13.9%), climate change (13.6%), and hydrological modeling (10.8%). A shift from resource-oriented studies to ecological hydrology was observed, with a growing focus on climate change and carbon dynamics. These findings reflect the evolution of Chinese hydrology from traditional water resource management to addressing contemporary environmental challenges, offering valuable insights for future research in China and globally.

AB  - Policy style is a crucial concept in policy science that reflects persistent patterns in the policy process across different governance settings. Despite its importance, policy style measurement faces issues of complexity, subjectivity, data sparseness, and computational cost. To overcome these obstacles, we propose KOALA, a novel KnOwledge distillation framework based on large lAnguage modeL collAboration. It transforms the weak scoring abilities of LLMs into a pairwise ranking problem, employs a small set of expert-annotated samples for non-parametric learning, and utilizes knowledge distillation to transfer insights from LLMs to a smaller, more efficient model. The framework incorporates multiple LLM-based agents (Prompter, Ranker, and Analyst) collaborating to comprehend complex measurement standards and self-explain policy style definitions. We validate KOALA on 4,572 Chinese government work reports (1954–2019) from central, provincial, and municipal levels, with a focus on the imposition dimension of policy style. Extensive experiments demonstrate KOALA’s effectiveness in measuring the intensity of policy style, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. While GPT-4 achieves only 66% accuracy in pairwise ranking of policy styles, KOALA, despite being based on GPT-3.5, achieves a remarkable 85% accuracy, highlighting significant performance improvement. This framework offers a transferable approach for quantifying complex social science concepts in textual data, bridging computational techniques with social science research.

AB  - Bacterial symbionts associated with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) play an important role in terms of the insecticidal properties of nematodes in pest control. Galleria mellonella larvae, shortly after being infected with three different strains of Heterorhabditis zealandica, which were isolated from South African soil, changed from pale white to steel grey-blue (blue), bright red, and yellow with a green tint (green), respectively. The genetic relatedness of the bacterial symbionts that were isolated from the three strains of H. zealandica was determined by means of comparing the 16S rRNA, recA, gyrB, dnaN, gltX and infB gene sequences. Subsequently, comparing the concatenated sequences revealed the presence of three distinct Photorhabdus species. The H. zealandica strain SF41, associated with Photorhabdus heterorhabditis, produced ‘blue’ G. mellonella larvae. The H. zealandica strain MJ2C, associated with Photorhabdus thracensis, yielded ‘green’ G. mellonella larvae, while the H. zealandica strain LLM associated with Photorhabdus laumondii subsp. laumondii yielded red larvae. The colour changes in G. mellonella larvae were found to have been instigated by a particular Photorhabdus species associated with H. zealandica. The red and ‘green’ phenotypes of G. mellonella larvae were found to represent new combinations of Heterorhabditis and Photorhabdus. In future studies, the colour of infected G. mellonella larvae needs to be reported as a phenotypic character, as it indicates the different bacterial species associated with the same nematode host, as shown in the case of H. zealandica.

AB  - Concerns about the negative impacts of microplastics on human health are increasing in society, while exposure and risk assessments require high-quality, reliable data. Although quality assurance and –control (QA/QC) frameworks exist to evaluate the reliability of data for these purposes, manually assessing studies is too time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies due to semantic ambiguities and evaluator bias. The rapid growth of microplastic studies makes manually screening relevant data practically unfeasible. This study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, to streamline and standardize the QA/QC screening of data in microplastics research. We developed specific prompts based on previously published QA/QC criteria for the analysis of microplastics in drinking water and its sources, and used these to instruct AI tools to evaluate 73 studies published between 2011 and 2024. Our approach demonstrated the effectiveness of AI in extracting relevant information, interpreting the reliability of studies, and replicating human assessments. The findings indicate that AI-assisted assessments show promise in improving speed, consistency and applicability in QA/QC tasks, as well as in ranking studies or datasets based on their suitability for exposure and risk assessments. This groundbreaking application of LLMs in the environmental sciences suggests that AI can play a vital role in harmonizing microplastics risk assessments within regulatory frameworks and demonstrates how to meet the demands of an increasingly data-intensive application domain.

AB  - The integration of generative artificial intelligence technology into research environments has become increasingly common in recent years, representing a significant shift in the way researchers approach their work. This paper seeks to explore the factors underlying the frequency of use of generative AI amongst researchers in their professional environments. As survey data may be influenced by a bias towards scientists interested in AI, potentially skewing the results towards the perspectives of these researchers, this study uses a regression model to isolate the impact of specific factors such as gender, career stage, type of workplace, and perceived barriers to using AI technology on the frequency of use of generative AI. It also controls for other relevant variables such as direct involvement in AI research or development, collaboration with AI companies, geographic location, and scientific discipline. Our results show that researchers who face barriers to AI adoption experience an 11 % increase in tool use, while those who cite insufficient training resources experience an 8 % decrease. Female researchers experience a 7 % decrease in AI tool usage compared to men, while advanced career researchers experience a significant 19 % decrease. Researchers associated with government advisory groups are 45 % more likely to use AI tools frequently than those in government roles. Researchers in for-profit companies show an increase of 19 %, while those in medical research institutions and hospitals show an increase of 16 % and 15 %, respectively. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the use of generative AI tools amongst researchers, with valuable implications for both academia and industry.

AB  - Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are widely used in ocean exploration, scientific research, and other fields that perform tasks in complex underwater environments. Since propellers fault samples are very scarce and difficult to collect in AUV practice, traditional fault diagnostics face the challenge of insufficient data. For this reason, a channel attention residual transfer learning (ECRTN) model based on dual-loss nonlinear independent component estimation (DLNICE) is proposed to expand data for few-shot fault diagnosis of AUVs. Specifically, DLNICE is first used to augment fault samples by combining both time and frequency-domain information of AUV propellers vibration signals with a dual-loss function. The augmented fault samples and normal data are fed into the channel-attention residual network, which is fine-tuned by the large language model. The fine-tuned model is then used to diagnose real vibration samples in the target domain. Experimental results show that the proposed ECRTN achieves an average diagnosis accuracy of 96.81 %, outperforming other state-of-the-art fault diagnosis models for dealing with few-shot fault diagnosis tasks. The present method provides an effective technical solution for the few-shot fault diagnosis of AUV propellers and has a better prospect for practical applications.

AB  - Rapid urbanization presents significant threats to biodiversity, especially in densely populated urban areas where ecological monitoring is both imperative and challenging. Accurate identification of urban species is essential for preserving ecosystem integrity; however, existing fine-grained classification methods often struggle with limited training data and high inter-class visual ambiguity To address these challenges, we propose LAMNet, a novel framework tailored for fine-grained few-shot image classification in the context of urban biodiversity monitoring. LAMNet integrates cross-modal learning with soft computing techniques to enhance feature discrimination under limited supervision. Specifically, the LLM-Cross module fuses semantic embeddings from large language models with visual features through a multilayer perceptron, yielding richer multimodal representations. In addition, we introduce two key modules: Salient Feature Optimization (SFO), which adaptively emphasizes informative local features, and Multi-Target Information Fusion (MTIF), a multi-target augmentation strategy designed to enhance generalization from limited data. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains over the baseline, with improvements of up to 8.64% in 1-shot accuracy. Furthermore, LAMNet attains a 1-shot accuracy of 87.5%, surpassing the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on this benchmark. These findings underscore the efficacy of LLM-enhanced cross-modal learning in enabling robust fine-grained classification. LAMNet offers a promising tool for the identification of urban species and the assessment of biodiversity, supporting conservation planning, and contributing to sustainable urban development.

AB  - Domain knowledge is a critical asset that provides the foundation for a range of building activities, including but not limited to design, construction, operation, and maintenance. However, existing approaches to knowledge engineering often require extensive up-front work and are limited in generalizability. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have undergone significant growth and demonstrated notable generalization and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, the deployment of LLMs in the field of buildings has been constrained by several factors, including hallucinations, a lack of domain-specific knowledge, difficulties in updating knowledge, and data security concerns. This study aims to develop an improved retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework based on domain characteristics for general, intelligent, and scalable AI-based applications. The primary advancement is the proposal of a hybrid index based on vectors, a property graph, and keywords, accompanied by a corresponding hybrid retrieval strategy. To evaluate the proposed framework comprehensively, three tasks were designed and executed: basic queries, risk and error recognition in complex queries, and open text generation. The results show that the improved RAG significantly outperforms the baseline and the native LLM in all three tasks. This study advances the integration of domain knowledge with generative AI and demonstrates the potential of LLM-RAG-based solutions for application in building lifecycle management.

AB  - Stages of growth ofSpongaster tetras tetras were observed using scanning electron microscopy. The earliest stage with a diagonal of about 75 to 100 μm is a biconvex, nearly lens-shaped, tabular structure. Subsequent growth by accretion of silica at the periphery produces a more quadrangular tabular skeleton that gradually increases in size by growth largely at the perimeter. The corners of the tabular skeleton at maturity are somewhat lobed due to the large quantities of silica deposited there during the later stages of development. Conspicuously larger pores occur in the surface of the skeleton at the four corners where the lobes are formed. Peripheral spines and a loose patagium of siliceous spongiose matter cover the surface of the skeleton at maturity (diagonal c. 300 to 400 μm). Based on a sample of skeletons of varying size collected in plankton tows near Barbados, a mathematical equation was derived relating mean weight of the skeleton of different maturational stages to the linear dimension in μm of the diagonal. This equation was used to estimate the amount of silica deposited per day in culture. It can also be used to estimate the amount of silica in samples of skeletons obtained from sediment cores, sediment traps or plankton tows that have been cleaned and prepared for observation with a light microscope. Based on this equation, the mean weight of silica deposited per day byS. tetras tetras grown at 28°C in culture ranged from 2.6 ng for individuals 100–120 μm diagonal dimension to 10 ng for those 221 to 240 μm in size. Growth curves in culture were highly variable with some individuals growing continuously while others grew sporadically. The abundances ofS. tetras tetras during March to August are reported. Peak abundances occurred in June and July during the warmer part of the seasonal temperature cycle. The mean skeletal weight ofS. tetras tetras in plankton tows based on six representative samples was 41.8 μg/m3.

AB  - Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas of the southeastern U.S. represent an archetype of a fire dependent ecosystem. They are known to have very short fire return intervals (∼1–3 years) that perpetuate understory plant diversity (up to 50 species m−2), support pine recruitment, and suppress fire sensitive hardwoods. Understanding the relationships that regulate longleaf and southern hardwoods is especially critical. With decreased fire frequency, insufficient intensity, or lack of underground competition, a woody mid-story rapidly develops, dominated by fire sensitive trees and shrubs that in-turn suppress more fire dependent species (including pine seedlings). This may occur in forest gaps, where pine-needle abundance is diminished, reducing fire spread potential. The interactions between longleaf pine, hardwoods, forest fuels, and fire frequency are complex and difficult to understand spatially. The objective of this study was to develop a spatially explicit longleaf pine–hardwood stochastic simulation model (LLM), incorporating tree demography, plant competition, and fuel and fire characteristics. Data from two longleaf pine study sites were used to develop and evaluate the model with the goal to incorporate simple site-specific calibration parameters for model versatility. Specific model components included pine seed masting, hardwood clonal sprouting, response to fire (re-sprouting, mortality), and tree density driven competition effects. LLM spatial outputs were consistent with observed forest gap dynamics associated with pine seedling establishment and hardwood encroachment. Changes in fire frequency (i.e., fire probability=0.35–0.05) illustrated a shift in community structure from longleaf pine dominated to a hardwood dominated community. This approach to assessing model response may be useful in characterizing longleaf ecosystem resilience, especially at intermediate fire frequencies (e.g., 0.15) where the community may be sensitive to small changes in the fire regime. Height distributions and population densities were similar to in situ findings (field and LIDAR data) for both study sites. Height distributions output by the LLM illustrated fluctuations in population structure. The LLM was especially useful in determining knowledge gaps associated with fuel and fire heterogeneity, plant–plant interactions, population structure and its temporal fluctuations, and hardwood demography. This is the first known modeling work to simulate interactions between longleaf pine and hardwoods and provides a foundation for further studies on fire and forest management, especially in relation to ecological forestry practices, restoration, and site-specific applications.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publication, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR), but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and future directions associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. This survey serves as an inspirational reference for the researchers and can promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.

AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a well-established approach and benchmark for design for sustainability efforts, in which detailed reports are produced that can serve as decision-making guides for developing new products. However, LCA reports are typically dense and technically complex, making it difficult for many engineering design project stakeholders to appropriately leverage the information found within them. Our work seeks to understand and improve the transfer of knowledge from LCA reports during the early stages of the design process, specifically leveraging the natural language capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we investigate how four LCA-and sustainability-centric prompting frameworks can extract relevant design knowledge from LCA reports, demonstrated through a case study where an LLM (ChatGPT) is prompted on a provided electric toothbrush LCA report. Key findings illustrate the prompting frameworks can establish high-level summaries and identify life-cycle specific information, but the development of specific and design-focused sub-prompts will allow for richer understanding. We envision designers can use these proposed frameworks to query an LLM to gain context and insights from relevant LCA reports. The proposed techniques serve as a basis for automatic knowledge extraction from life cycle documents, creating accessible information in a user-friendly manner for designers who look to develop life-cycle-informed products.

AB  - This study examines the role of news media in the context of generative AI-enhanced search engines, focusing on the 2024 Taiwan presidential election. Using Microsoft’s Copilot, we conducted a comparative analysis by prompting election news in five languages: English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, German, and Swedish. While Copilot uses mainly professional news media, provides quick access to synthesized information, and exhibits source transparency, it frequently creates misinformation and misattributes news sources. The analysis highlights variations in Copilot’s sourcing behavior, showing a strong reliance on English-language sources, particularly those from the UK and US, across different prompting languages. Such reliance raises concerns about the homogenization of information and the marginalization of regional perspectives. The study underscores the critical role and dilemma of news media, which, while serving as authoritative sources in democratic societies, must navigate an increasing AI-mediated information ecosystem to maintain autonomy vis-à-vis powerful technological infrastructures. By evaluating Copilot’s sourcing practices and misinformation prevalence, this research contributes to the discourse on AI’s impact on news dissemination, media diversity, and democratic processes. Specifically, we discuss the consequences of two approaches available to news media to prevent their content from being used without compensation: opting out of crawling (“platform counterbalancing”) or establishing partnerships with AI companies. Current regulatory efforts, including copyright reforms and the EU AI Act, fall short of safeguarding journalism or regulating AI. We propose policy and regulatory recommendations to improve transparency, factual correctness, accuracy in source attribution, and accountability in AI-generated content, supporting informed citizenship in the digital age.

AB  - The Paris Agreement mandates that countries report on their adaptation efforts to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of these measures. Agriculture, a critical sector in climate change adaptation, benefits significantly from global case studies that provide evidence, share experiences, and disseminate knowledge. However, the rapid expansion of these case studies presents challenges in extracting and analyzing relevant information effectively. To address this, this study developed a question‒answering information extraction framework that combines geographic analysis with ChatGPT. Guided by the Systematic Evidence Synthesis (ROSES) review protocol, we established a comprehensive global database of agricultural adaptation cases from 2000 to 2024. This database includes key information such as case distribution, climate stressors, adaptation measures, cost-effectiveness, and constraints, aimed at identifying major trends in agricultural adaptation. Our findings reveal the following: 1) Natural language processing technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), greatly enhance the efficiency and depth of extracting key information from adaptation cases. This advancement supports the frequent updating of the agricultural adaptation database. 2) There is a notable geographic imbalance in agricultural adaptation efforts globally. Adaptation cases are concentrated in central and southern Africa, southern Asia, Europe, and other regions. While there is diversity in responses to slow onset events, measures for extreme climate events are less common, indicating a gap in the sector's ability to address sudden and uncertain challenges. 3) Agricultural adaptation measures are evolving from individual technologies to more comprehensive approaches. The shift is from methods like crop improvement and irrigation adjustments to integrated measures such as climate-smart agriculture, conservation agriculture, and sustainable practices. These approaches collectively enhance adaptation capacity through technological, managerial, infrastructural, and biodiversity improvements, reflecting a deeper understanding and ongoing refinement of adaptation practices. This study highlights the significant potential of LLMs in improving the efficiency of information extraction and analysis for global adaptation research. It offers new methods for quickly summarizing adaptation cases in agriculture and potentially other fields, providing valuable insights and recommendations for global agricultural policymakers.

AB  - The construction of a Global Maritime Capital has become an important link in responding to China’s maritime strategy and the “One Belt One Road Initiative”. In the process of constructing a Global Maritime Capital, while giving full play to the characteristic industries of the city, the Global Maritime Capital’s influence on the region and the world will be improved through the governance of the Global Maritime Capital’s economy, resources, ecology, culture, technology and other fields. The construction of a Global Maritime Capital, as a systematic ocean governance method involving multiple fields, should also be subject to the standards of good ocean governance. Through an assessment from the perspective of ocean governance, it is argued that the construction of China’s Global Maritime Capital still entails further improvement in the advancement of rule of law, public participation, and responsiveness to new standards and rules.

AB  - With the artificial intelligence technology development boom, large language models are demonstrating their potential in comprehension and creativity. Large language models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have been able to powerfully study for various professional-level exams. However, as a language model itself, its powerful comprehension can only be reflected in text sequences. Currently, although videos can be generated through the connection between 3D point clouds and large language models, there is currently no prompt project that directly interacts with one-dimensional through attribute calculation results. The point cloud data is also rich in information that can support various tasks of urban construction. For scene-level point cloud data, there has been a lot of research done on semantic segmentation, target detection, and other tasks. However, it is usually difficult to provide direct help to scene construction from the perception results. This paper presents a method for applying large language models to urban ecological construction by combining the results of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The objective is to integrate the prior knowledge and creative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within urban development with the outcomes derived from point cloud semantic segmentation results. This integration aims to establish an interactive point cloud intelligent analysis system, tailored for aiding decision-making processes in urban ecological civilization construction, thus presenting innovative perspectives for the advancement of smart city development.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing specialized fields by enabling advanced reasoning and data synthesis. Environmental science, however, poses unique hurdles due to its interdisciplinary scope, specialized jargon, and heterogeneous data from climate dynamics to ecosystem management. Despite progress in subdomains like hydrology and climate modeling, no integrated framework exists to generate high-quality, domain-specific training data or evaluate LLM performance across the discipline. Here we introduce a unified pipeline to address this gap. It comprises EnvInstruct, a multi-agent system for prompt generation; ChatEnv, a balanced 100-million-token instruction dataset spanning five core themes (climate change, ecosystems, water resources, soil management, and renewable energy); and EnvBench, a 4998-item benchmark assessing analysis, reasoning, calculation, and description tasks. Applying this pipeline, we fine-tune an 8-billion-parameter model, EnvGPT, which achieves 92.06 ± 1.85 % accuracy on the independent EnviroExam benchmark—surpassing the parameter-matched LLaMA-3.1–8B baseline by ∼8 percentage points and rivaling the closed-source GPT-4o-mini and the 9-fold larger Qwen2.5–72B. On EnvBench, EnvGPT earns top LLM-assigned scores for relevance (4.87 ± 0.11), factuality (4.70 ± 0.15), completeness (4.38 ± 0.19), and style (4.85 ± 0.10), outperforming baselines in every category. This study reveals how targeted supervised fine-tuning on curated domain data can propel compact LLMs to state-of-the-art levels, bridging gaps in environmental applications. By openly releasing EnvGPT, ChatEnv, and EnvBench, our work establishes a reproducible foundation for accelerating LLM adoption in environmental research, policy, and practice, with potential extensions to multimodal and real-time tools.

AB  - As climate change and resource scarcity threaten global food security, greenhouse systems are becoming critical for sustainable agriculture. Advanced control, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), effectively regulates temperature, humidity, and CO2 to enhance crop growth and resource efficiency. However, the widespread adoption of such advanced control systems is limited by their lack of interpretability, as growers struggle to understand complex control decisions, particularly during rapid environmental changes. In this work, a Natural Language Generation (NLG) interface has been developed to bridge this gap and transform MPC control decisions into clear, actionable explanations for greenhouse growers. This interface integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with greenhouse control systems and mathematical constraints, providing a step toward making AI-driven agriculture more accessible. This integration addresses the need for interpretable AI systems in modern agricultural applications. The system allows growers to interact with the control system, query decisions, and receive contextually relevant explanations through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms and instruction prompting techniques. The Adaptive RAG (ARAG) framework was evaluated using semantic similarity, information retrieval, and contextual relevance metrics, demonstrating a 12.1% improvement in BERTScore, over baseline methods. These results highlight the system's ability to deliver accurate, well-structured explanations without compromising control performance. By improving the interpretability and accessibility of AI-powered greenhouse automation, this research advances the development of sustainable greenhouse practices that can adapt to the challenges of climate change and resource scarcity. The proposed system represents a significant step toward transforming traditional greenhouse control into more interpretable solutions for modern agriculture.

AB  - Four Thai – rumen fistulated male swamp buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis), about 3 years old with 360±18kg liveweight, were randomly assigned according to a 2×2 factorial arrangement in a 4×4 Latin square design to receive four dietary treatments. The treatments were as follows: a cassava based supplement (CS) at 1g/kg BW and Leucaena leucocephala leaf meal (LLM) at 300g/d (T1); CS at 2g/kg BW with LLM at 300g/d (T2); CS at 1g/kg BW and heat treated LLM (HLLM) at 300g/d (T3); and CS at 2g/kg BW and HLLM at 300g/d. During the experiment, urea–calcium hydroxide treated rice straw was given on ad libitum basis. The results revealed an increase in roughage and total dry matter (DM) intake (P<0.05) by CS at 2g/kg BW (T2 and T4) as compared with CS at 1g/kg BW (T1 and T3). Digestion coefficients of DM, organic matter (OM), and crude protein (CP) were increased by CS at 2g/kg BW, while neutral detergent fiber (aNDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) were similar among treatments. However, there was no effect of neither energy level nor HLLM on ruminal pH and temperature (P>0.05). Concentration of ruminal ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) was decreased by HLLM as compared with LLM (P<0.05), while blood urea–nitrogen was not altered. There was an increase (P<0.05) in total volatile fatty acid (TVFA), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), and butyric acid (C4) concentrations and the highest were found in CS at 2g/kg BW with HLLM (T4), while the lowest was in T1 and T3. However, no changes in C2–C3 ratio were found in this study. Total bacterial direct counts were found different (P<0.05), whereas fungal zoospores and protozoal populations were similar among treatments. Nevertheless, viable bacterial counts were found affected by both concentrate level and HLLM. The treatments with HLLM were lower than those in LLM and CS at 2g/kg BW were higher than those supplemented at CS at 1g/kg BW (P<0.05). In addition, efficiency of rumen microbial CP synthesis tended to be higher in treatment with higher level of energy and HLLM. Based on this study, it could be concluded that LLM could be used as a protein source, while the combination of HLLM and CS at 2g/kg BW could enhance the voluntary feed intake, nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation in swamp buffalo fed on treated rice straw (urea–calcium hydroxide treatment).

AB  - The vast volume of currently available unstructured text data, such as research papers, news, and technical report data, shows great potential for ecological research. However, manual processing of such data is labour-intensive, posing a significant challenge. In this study, we aimed to assess the application of three state-of-the-art prompt-based large language models (LLMs), GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2-70B, to automate the identification, interpretation, extraction, and structuring of relevant ecological information from unstructured textual sources. We focused on species distribution data from two sources: news outlets and research papers. We assessed the LLMs for four key tasks: classification of documents with species distribution data, identification of regions where species are recorded, generation of geographical coordinates for these regions, and supply of results in a structured format. GPT-4 consistently outperformed the other models, demonstrating a high capacity to interpret textual data and extract relevant information, with the percentage of correct outputs often exceeding 90% (average accuracy across tasks: 87–100%). Its performance also depended on the data source type and task, with better results achieved with news reports, in the identification of regions with species reports and presentation of structured output. Its predecessor, GPT-3.5, exhibited slightly lower accuracy across all tasks and data sources (average accuracy across tasks: 81–97%), whereas LLaMA-2-70B showed the worst performance (37–73%). These results demonstrate the potential benefit of integrating prompt-based LLMs into ecological data assimilation workflows as essential tools to efficiently process large volumes of textual data.

AB  - As ESG considerations gain increasing prominence, investors’ preferences for ESG factors are evolving, potentially influencing corporate governance practices. This study examines how fund managers’ ESG preferences affect the green innovation efforts of the firms they hold. Using large language models (LLMs) to analyze fund managers’ discussions in the quarterly reports of China’s mutual funds, we find that firms held by fund managers with stronger ESG preferences tend to demonstrate better green innovation performance. The positive impact of ESG-conscious fund managers on green innovation is primarily driven by increased R&D expenditures, the hiring of additional R&D personnel, and the alleviation of financing constraints. Additionally, the strength of this effect varies with factors such as analyst coverage, environmental performance, corporate governance structures of the firms, and the consistency of fund managers’ ESG preferences. This research not only highlights the utility of LLMs in corporate finance studies but also offers valuable insights into the role of fund managers’ personal preferences in shaping corporate governance and innovation strategies.

AB  - Despite the recent stunning progress in large-scale deep neural network applications, our understanding of their microstructure, ‘energy’ functions, and optimal design remains incomplete. Here, we present a new game-theoretic framework, called statistical teleodynamics, that reveals important insights into these key properties. The optimally robust design of such networks inherently involves computational benefit–cost trade-offs that physics-inspired models do not adequately capture. These trade-offs occur as neurons and connections compete to increase their effective utilities under resource constraints during training. In a fully trained network, this results in a state of arbitrage equilibrium, where all neurons in a given layer have the same effective utility, and all connections to a given layer have the same effective utility. The equilibrium is characterized by the emergence of two lognormal distributions of connection weights and neuronal output as the universal microstructure of large deep neural networks. We call such a network the Jaynes Machine. Our theoretical predictions are shown to be supported by empirical data from seven large-scale deep neural networks. We also show that the Hopfield network and the Boltzmann Machine are the same special case of the Jaynes Machine.

AB  - Background
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India.
Objective
This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions.
Methods
In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models.
Results
It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59.
Conclusions
The study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.

AB  - Ethical frameworks for text generators (TGs) in education are generally concerned with personalized instruction, a dependency on data, biases in training data, academic integrity, and lack of creativity from students. While broad-level, institutional guidelines provide value in understanding the ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) for the classroom, there is a need for a more ecological understanding of how AI ethics might be constructed locally, one that takes into account the negotiation of AI between teacher and student. This article investigates how an educational ethical framework for AI use emerges through a qualitative case study of one composition student's interaction with and understanding of using ChatGPT as a type of writing partner. Analysis of interview data and student logs uncover what we term an emergent “local ethic” – a framework that is capable of exploring unique ethical considerations, values, and norms that develop at the most foundational unit of higher education – the individual classroom. Our framework is meant to provide a heuristic for other writing teacher-scholars as they interrogate issues related to pedagogy, student criticality, agency, reliability, and access within the context of powerful AI systems.

AB  - We are currently in an era of escalating technological complexity and profound societal transformations, where artificial intelligence (AI) technologies exemplified by large language models (LLMs) have reignited discussions on the ‘Technological Singularity’. ‘Technological Singularity’ is a philosophical concept referring to an irreversible and profound transformation that occurs when AI capabilities surpass those of humans comprehensively. However, quantitative modeling and analysis of the historical evolution and future trends of AI technologies remain scarce, failing to substantiate the singularity hypothesis adequately. This paper hypothesizes that the development of AI technologies could be characterized by the superposition of multiple logistic growth processes. To explore this hypothesis, we propose a multi-logistic growth process model and validate it using two real-world datasets: AI Historical Statistics and Arxiv AI Papers. Our analysis of the AI Historical Statistics dataset assesses the effectiveness of the multi-logistic model and evaluates the current and future trends in AI technology development. Additionally, cross-validation experiments on the Arxiv AI Paper, GPU Transistor and Internet User dataset enhance the robustness of our conclusions derived from the AI Historical Statistics dataset. The experimental results reveal that around 2024 marks the fastest point of the current AI wave, and the deep learning-based AI technologies are projected to decline around 2035–2040 if no fundamental technological innovation emerges. Consequently, the technological singularity appears unlikely to arrive in the foreseeable future.

AB  - Collaborative Problem Solving Skills (CPS Skills) as the core literacy of talents in the 21st century, the analysis and assessment of it is an important issue in the field of education. With the advancement of digitalization and intelligence in education, the application of artificial intelligence technology in education tends to be the norm, which also brings more opportunities and challenges to the analysis of CPS skills. At present, CPS skills assessment is mainly conducted based on computers with high training costs. The superior creation ability, reasoning ability and interpretability of AI agents can precisely solve the limitations of the current computer-based analysis and assessment of students’ abilities. In this paper, we propose an analysis method of CPS skills based on students’ conversation data in complex problem situations, and design an AI agent framework based on the method to automate the analysis and assessment of CPS skills, to provide scientific and effective evaluation tools and improvement suggestions for the educational practice in the intelligent era.

AB  - Due to shifts in society sustainable products are increasingly gaining market attention while laws regulate realization. Known sustainability models primarily focus on social and ecological factors relating to people and their environment. The consideration of sustainability in product development requires an addressable translation as well as the inclusion of economic aspects. In this paper, a sustainability target system for product development is proposed to enhance interoperability between sustainability models and product development and to systematically support analyzing problem shifts. Based on a literature review, the capability of influencing the target variables is evaluated considering the phases of the product life cycle and generalizable problem shifts. Using a requirements methodology for goals, restrictions, solutions, and an assigned syntax, the problem shifts in product development can be identified, captured, and addressed. For the validation, an implementation of requirements for a sustainability certification of a product is examined. As a result, the sustainability target system for product development supports the product developers in gaining situational awareness due to a sharper focus on relevant target variables and the lifecycle phases in which they can be influenced. Finally, this approach enables potential for the implementation of computer-aided assistance systems.

AB  - Meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) presents a large-scale challenge for all countries. SDGs established by the United Nations provide a comprehensive framework for addressing global issues. To monitor progress towards these goals, we need to develop key performance indicators and integrate and analyze heterogeneous datasets. The definition of these indicators requires the use of existing data and metadata. However, the diversity of data sources and formats raises major issues in terms of structuring and integration. Despite the abundance of open data and metadata, its exploitation remains limited, leaving untapped potential for guiding urban policies towards sustainability. Thus, this paper introduces a novel approach for SDG indicator computation, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We propose a method that combines rule-based filtering with LLM-powered schema mapping to establish semantic correspondences between diverse data sources and SDG indicators, including disaggregation. Our approach integrates these mappings into a KG, which enables indicator computation by querying graph’s topology. We evaluate our method through a case study focusing on the SDG Indicator 11.7.1 about accessibility of public open spaces. Our experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to traditional schema mapping techniques.

AB  - The present paper discusses the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) may affect the scientific enterprise, reinforcing or mitigating existing structural inequalities expressed by the Matthew Effect and introducing a “bot delusion” in academia. In a theory-led thought experiment, we first focus on the academic publication and citation system and develop three scenarios of the anticipated consequences of using LLMs: reproducing content and status quo (Scenario 1), enabling content coherence evaluation (Scenario 2) and content evaluation (Scenario 3). Second, we discuss the interaction between the use of LLMs and academic (counter)norms for citation selection and their impact on the publication and citation system. Finally, we introduce communal counter-norms to capture academics’ loyal citation behavior and develop three future scenarios that academia may face when LLMs are widely used in the research process, namely status quo future of science, mixed-access future, and open science future.

AB  - The study of cooperation within social dilemmas has long been a fundamental topic across various disciplines, including computer science and social science. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have significantly reshaped this field, offering fresh insights into understanding and enhancing cooperation. This survey examines three key areas at the intersection of AI and cooperation in social dilemmas. First, focusing on multi-agent cooperation, we review the intrinsic and external motivations that support cooperation among rational agents, and the methods employed to develop effective strategies against diverse opponents. Second, looking into human–agent cooperation, we discuss the current AI algorithms for cooperating with humans and the human biases towards AI agents. Third, we review the emergent field of leveraging AI agents to enhance cooperation among humans. We conclude by discussing future research avenues, such as using large language models, establishing unified theoretical frameworks, revisiting existing theories of human cooperation, and exploring multiple real-world applications.
