- TESTS!!!!
- Pass db_path as env
- Let the user finetune the configuration for the LLMs using litellm yaml config.
- Improve SQL work. Don't close transactions early. For example, reading a file may fail but the file was already stored. This is a bug.
- basically, improve everything
- Tokens: inspect use, restrict calls and use, etc.
