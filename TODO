- TESTS!!!!
- Change the whole thing: use 'recipes', .toml files with all the information, model, model temp, prompt, criteria, everything.
- Pass db_path as env
- Improve SQL work. Don't close transactions early. For example, reading a file may fail but the file was already stored. This is a bug.
- Tokens: inspect use, restrict calls and use, etc.
